        <h2>DUCKY BAI EXPOSED</h2>

</P>
<P>According to official documents, the NCCIA has directed Mudassar Hassan, Muhammad Anas Ali, Iqra Kanwal, and Muhammad Husnain Shah to appear in person on September 2, 2025, at the NCCIA office in Lahore, as part of an ongoing investigation.

The individuals are accused of promoting illegal online trading and gambling apps and motivating youth to invest in unregulated betting platforms using social media to glamorize and legitimize these investments designing a coordinated scheme to defraud the public by encouraging investments in unregistered, non-licensed applications.

The NCCIA statement further notes that failure to appear will be interpreted as an admission of guilt or forfeiture of the right to present a defense.

Earlier investigative findings supported by whistleblower accounts revealed that the controversial online betting platform “World 777” has been aggressively funding influencer marketing campaigns across social media, luring thousands of unsuspecting Pakistanis, especially youth, into the high-risk world of online gambling.

A list of high-profile figures allegedly involved in promoting the app includes Mathira (model and media personality), Nadir Ali (YouTuber), Aimen Zaman. Varda Malik, Javeria Aurangzeb, Abeera Khan and Faryal Fairy. Nauman Kazmi.

Officials estimate that billions of rupees are being funneled out of Pakistan each month through these unregulated platforms — creating a shadow economy that undermines the country’s financial stability while fueling addiction and financial ruin among vulnerable users.</P>
